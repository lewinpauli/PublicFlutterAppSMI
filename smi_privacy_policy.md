**PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING DATA**

Saint Martin’s Institute of Higher Education (hereinafter referred to as the Institute) collects

processes about you and why, who has access to it, how it is held and kept up to date, for

how long it is kept, and what the Institute is doing to comply with data protection legislation.

The GDPR establishes a formal procedure for dealing with data subject access requests. All

data subjects have the right to access any personal information kept about them by the

Institute, either on computer or in manual files. Requests for access to personal information

by data subjects are to be made in writing and sent to the Registrar of the Institute. Your

identification details such as identity card number, name and surname have to be submitted

with the request for access. In case we encounter identification difficulties, you may be

required to present an identification document. The Institute aims to comply as quickly as

possible with requests for access to personal information and will ensure that it is provided

within a reasonable timeframe and in any case not later than one month from receipt of

request, unless there is good reason for delay. When a request for access cannot be met

within a reasonable time, the reason will be explained in writing to the data subject making

the request. Should there be any data breaches, the data subject will be informed accordingly.

All data subjects have the right to request that their information is amended, erased or not

used in the event the data results to be incorrect. In case you are not satisfied with the

outcome of your access request, you may refer a complaint to the Information and Data
